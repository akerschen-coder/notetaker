# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description and Challenges 
Using this app, users are able to go to the notes route and then able to make notes and delete them. The challenges in making this app was making it cleaner and remembering all the details. For making it cleaner, I was able to put most of the functions in a class and pulling the class over to routes. 

## User Story
